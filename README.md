# Smart Cruise: Self-Driving Car 🚗💡

## Overview

Welcome to **Smart Cruise: Self-Driving Car**, a sophisticated self-driving car simulation project. This project leverages AI, pathfinding algorithms, and dynamic obstacle detection to create a realistic and engaging simulation experience.

## Features

### 🚦 Checkpoints
The car navigates through designated checkpoints, simulating a real-world scenario where it follows a specific route. Each checkpoint reached is a step closer to the goal!

### 💨 Speed Boost Zones
Strategically placed speed boost zones give the car a temporary speed increase when entered, adding excitement and a new layer of strategy to navigation.

### 🛑 Collision Detection
Safety is paramount. The car detects and avoids obstacles, stopping if it encounters any, ensuring a realistic and reliable simulation.

### ⛽ Fuel Management
The car consumes fuel as it navigates. It must reach checkpoints before running out of fuel, simulating the challenges of long-distance travel and resource management.

### 🔍 A* Pathfinding
Enhanced with A* pathfinding, the navigation algorithm optimizes the car’s route to checkpoints, ensuring efficient and intelligent navigation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WEB-BLEACHERZ/smart-cruise.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd smart-cruise
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the simulation:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

- Use the `main.py` file to start the simulation.
- The car will automatically navigate the track, aiming to pass through checkpoints and avoid obstacles.
- Observe the car's behavior in speed boost zones and its fuel management strategy.
